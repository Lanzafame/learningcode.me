Currently testing out a new static site generator called
[Hugo](http://gohugo.io).

So far I am happy. And since it is written in [Golang](http://golang.org),
which is one of the three languages I have decided to focus my attention on,
this means I can hack away at some of its internals when I find the time :-/.
