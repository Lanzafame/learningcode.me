Not everyday do you get the chance to build a mobile API backend from scratch,
for an app that has 6k+ users already. I feel like I have been given that big
juicy problem that I can sink my teeth into. There will always be something
that I can do better, some part that needs tweaking. Maybe I am crazy but the
possibility of an endless number of puzzles is very enticing. 

Currently I am working on my stack, there are parts, technologies, that I have
never had to consider before. But the part I am most excited for is Go. So over
the next few weeks I am going to be blogging about design choices, API
architecture, and Go, possibly turn it into a 'The Good, the Bad, and the
Ugly' series.

Till next time.
